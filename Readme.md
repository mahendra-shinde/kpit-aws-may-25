## **AWS Fundamentals Summary**

### 1. **Cloud Computing Basics**

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. It eliminates the need for owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers.

#### **Benefits of Cloud Computing**

* **Scalability:** Resources can be increased or decreased as needed.
* **Cost-Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use.
* **High Availability:** Cloud platforms offer built-in redundancy.
* **Agility:** Faster provisioning of resources.

---

### 2. **Cloud Deployment Models**

* **Public Cloud:** Services offered over the public internet (e.g., AWS, Azure).
* **Private Cloud:** Used exclusively by a single organization.
* **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of public and private environments.

---

### 3. **Cloud Service Models**

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2).
* **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides development platforms and tools (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
* **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., Google Workspace).

---

### 4. **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**

Amazon VPC allows users to create a logically isolated network in the AWS cloud.

#### **Key Components:**

* **Subnets:** Segments within a VPC (public/private).
* **Internet Gateway:** Enables internet access to public subnets.
* **NAT Gateway:** Allows private subnets to access the internet.
* **Route Tables & Network ACLs:** Control traffic routing and security.

---

### 5. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud.

#### **Key Concepts:**

* **Instance Types:** Varying compute/memory optimized options.
* **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** A pre-configured template used to launch instances.
* **Pricing Models:** On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, Free Tier.
* **vCPU:** Virtual Central Processing Unit, the smallest unit of compute.

---

### 6. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

IAM controls access to AWS services securely.

#### **Entities in IAM:**

* **Users:** Individuals with long-term credentials.
* **Groups:** Collection of users with common permissions.
* **Roles:** Temporary access granted to services or users.
* **Policies:** Permissions written in JSON format.

---

### 7. **AWS Cognito**

Amazon Cognito enables secure user sign-up, sign-in, and access control.

#### **Components:**

* **User Pools:** Managed user directories.
* **Federated Identities:** Allow users to authenticate via external identity providers (e.g., Facebook, Google).
* **Token-Based Authentication:** Supports OAuth and JWT tokens.

---

### 8. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

S3 is an object storage service used to store and retrieve any amount of data.

#### **Features:**

* **Storage Classes:** Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier, and more.
* **Key-Value Storage:** Objects are stored with a unique key.
* **Lifecycle Policies:** Automatically transition data between storage classes.
* **Versioning and Access Control:** Manage object versions and permissions.

---

### 9. **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**



ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy container images.

#### **Key Integrations:**

* Works with **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** and **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** to deploy containerized applications.

* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Integrate ECR with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for automated container image builds and deployments.
* **Third-Party Tools:** Use ECR with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for streamlined DevOps workflows.
* **Cross-Account Access:** Share container images across multiple AWS accounts using resource-based policies.
* **Image Scanning:** Integrate with Amazon Inspector or third-party security tools for vulnerability scanning of container images.
